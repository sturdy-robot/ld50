# Ideas for the game

Okay, so settling in for a Vampire Chasing game.

You're a character that has to avoid a vampire. Each time you collect a gem, the Vampire retreats a bit.
Endless sidescroller?

I guess this is what the theme suggests, and what most people are going to do. But inevitably you're gonna die,
cause it's gonna get harder and harder. Maybe do more stages with different graphics and sounds just to vary?

Procedurally generated stages?


So the character will stay at the center of the screen. This will be a platformer game.

The Vampire on the left will always approach your character, unless you collect gems.

I'll be using embedded resources for testing and prototyping. I'll create the artwork later.
